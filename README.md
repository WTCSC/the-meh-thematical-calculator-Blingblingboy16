## Meh-thematical Calculator
##### Savannah Finn
> This program is a simple calculator capable of doing simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. However, you'll find this device is very resentful of its job and very unwilling to help you with whatever equation you ask it to complete.
##### Requirements
* Python3
##### Startup and Gameplay
start the program by entering ```python3 meth.py``` into your terminal
> Start by typing in the operation (+,-,*,/) you want it to do and then give it the two numbers you want to calculate. Watch it begrudgingly give you the answer to your math problem.
###### It should look something like this-
```
--- Welcome to the Meh-thematical calculator, please don't ask me any questions.---
1. Addition? Really?
2. Subtraction? We have to be joking.
```

###### Only choose from the 4 main operations and only give it two numbers. This calculator was made by a 16 year old and can only do the same basic math that its creator.
